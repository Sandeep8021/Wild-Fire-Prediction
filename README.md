# Wildfire Analysis and Prediction (1992-2015)

## Project Overview
- This project involves a detailed analysis and prediction of wildfires in the United States from 1992 to 2015. Utilizing a dataset with over 1.88 million records, the study focuses on understanding the patterns and causes of wildfires and developing machine learning models to predict the duration and likely causes of these events.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is the "Spatial wildfire occurrence data for the United States, 1992-2015 [FPA_FOD_20170508]," a comprehensive record of 1.88 million wildfires. The data was sourced from federal, state, and local reporting systems and standardized according to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG) standards.

## Core Data Elements
- FIRE_YEAR: Year when the fire was discovered.
* DISCOVERY_DATE: Exact date when the fire was discovered.
+ FIRE_SIZE: Size of the fire in acres.
- FIRE_SIZE_CLASS: Categorical size class of the fire.
* STAT_CAUSE_DESCR: Descriptive cause of the fire.
+ LATITUDE, LONGITUDE: Geolocation of the fire.
- STATE: US state where the fire occurred.
* COUNTY: County where the fire occurred.
